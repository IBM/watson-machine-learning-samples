# Sample notebooks for IBM watsonx.ai for IBM Cloud and IBM watsonx.ai software product

The sample notebooks in this repo demonstrate Watson Machine Learning and watsonx.ai capabilities such as:
- Running experiments on model building using AutoAI or Deep Learning
- Deploying third-party models as web services or batch jobs (i.e.: scikit-learn, xgboost, keras, PMMl, SPSS, etc.)
- Monitoring deployments with OpenScale (drift, bias detection)
- Managing model lifecycles (updating the model version, refreshing a deployment)
- Inferencing watsonx.ai foundation models
- Integrating LangChain with watsonx.ai

Notebooks with Python code and the Python SDK can be found in the `python_sdk` folder. The REST API examples are organized in the `rest_api` folder.

## Deployments

This section contains sample notebooks with examples of how to serve different types of models, either as online or batch jobs.
