    "This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of complaint classification in watsonx. It introduces commands for data retrieval and model testing.\n",

    "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a federal U.S. agency that acts as a mediator when disputes arise between financial institutions and consumers. Via a web form, consumers can send the agency a narrative of their dispute. A foundation model would make the classification of complaints and their routing to the appropriate teams more efficient than manually tagged complaints.\n",
