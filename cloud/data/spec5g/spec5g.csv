0,"In 5G NR, for the procedures such as handover to a stronger cells or adding a new Carrier Component (CC) in the case of Carrier Aggression, it is required to measure the serving cell and neighbor cell signal strength or signal quality matrix i.e. RSRP or RSRQ. This requirement enables the measurement process to be executed appropriately, maintaining the radio link quality. In LTE, all eNodeBs continually transmits Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS), so it is easy for the mobile device to measure the cell quality of neighboring cells. However in 5G NR, there is the concept of CRS has be removed to reduce the overhead and Reference Signal interference from other cells.","In 5G NR, signal strength or signal quality matrix (RSRP or RSRQ) must be assessed for handover to a stronger cell or adding a new Carrier Component (CC) in Carrier Aggression. This ensures correct measurement and radio link quality. In LTE, all eNodeBs transmit CRS so mobile devices can readily measure cell quality. 5G NR removes CRS to reduce cell interference."
1,"5G NR has introduced cell signal measurement by using SS/PBCH Block (SSB), which is composed of Synchronizations Signal (SS) and Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) having longer transmission periodicity than CRS. The number of SSB in one burst depend on the Operating frequency. If Operating frequency (fc) is < 3GHz (FR1) the no. of SSB is 4, for  fc = 3GHz to 6 GHz (FR1) no. of SSB  is 8 and for fc >6 GHz mm-wave no. of SSB is be 64 within one burst.","5G NR measures cell signal with SS/PBCH Block (SSB), which has a longer transmission period than CRS. Frequency affects SSB bursts. Operating frequency (fc) of 3GHz (FR1) has 4 SSB, 3GHz to 6GHz (FR1) has 8, and >6GHz has 64 mm-wave SSB in one burst."
2,New Radio (NR) is the wireless standard and foundation for the 5th generation of mobile networks.Its development is part of continuous mobile broadband evolution process to meet the requirements of 5G as outlined by IMT-2020. NR aims to make wireless broadband same as of wireline with the fiber-like performance at a significantly lower cost-per-bit. To achieve this NR is exploring new spectrum opportunities to address the expected capacity and data rates and this spectrum is spread in cmWave and mmWaves band.,New Radio (NR) is the wireless standard and foundation for the 5th generation of mobile networks. Its development is part of continuous mobile baseband evolution process to meet the requirements of 5G.
3,"Current regulations in the U.S. allow a device with such a high EIRP but not in a mobile phone form factor. However, achieving this EIRP is a technical challenge by itself and may come to the market at a much later stage. From that perspective, a service provider should consider a shorter ISD in its business case. Current literature and presentations at various conferences indicate that cell sizes of 250 m or less are being planned for the early stage of radio equipment. Now it needs to be determined if a shorter ISD, such as 250 m, fulfills the business case for 5G mmWave FWA.","Current literature and presentations at various conferences indicate the cell sizes are of 250 m or less are being planned for the early stage of radio equipment. It needs to be determined if a shorter ISD such as 250m, fulfills the business case of 5G mmWave."
4,"In general, it is  very critical for a UE to consider the certain assumption in terms of the relationship between the radio channels experienced by different downlink transmissions e.g. UE needs to understand what reference signal(s) should be used for channel estimation for a certain downlink transmission and determine relevant channel-state information required for scheduling and link-adaptation purposes. For the same reason, the concept of antenna port is used in the 5G NR and it follows the same principles as in 4G LTE. The term “antenna port” is a logical concept related to physical layer (L1), and not the physical one like RF antenna which is visible on tower.",It is important for UE to consider the certain assumption in terms of relationshops between the radio channels experienced by different downlink transmissions. The concept of antenna port is same in 4G and 5G. 
5,"NR supports both wideband and narrowband precoding for the PDCCH. In wideband precoding, PDCCH DMRSs are transmitted in all contiguous REGs of a CORESET carrying the PDCCH using the same precoder. On the other hand, in the narrowband precoding, PDCCH DMRSs are transmitted only in the REG bundles actually used for the PDCCH transmission, and precoding is constant only within the REG bundle. The former can maximize the frequency domain processing gain and the latter can take advantage of frequency dependent beamforming gain. Since the same precoding is applied to payload and the corresponding DMRS, precoding is transparent to the UE.","NR supports narrowband and wideband PDCCH. Wideband precoding uses the same precoder for all contiguous REGs of a CORESET. Narrowband precoding transmits PDCCH DMRSs only in REG bundles and is constant only within the REG bundle. First, optimize FDP gain, then FDB gain. Payload and DMRS precoding is transparent to the UE."
6,"Radio channel between the base station and UE introduces delay spread in the time domain. This delay spread is generated by the transmitted signal reaching the receiver from multiple paths which have different distances environment, terrain, and clutter result in different delays. Delay spread of the received signal pulse caused by multi-path is the difference between the maximum transmission latency in largest path and the minimum transmission latency in shorted path. The latency varies with the varies with the environment, terrain, and clutter, and does not have an absolute mapping relationship with the cell radius.","Radio channel delay spread between base station and UE. This delay dispersion is caused by the broadcast signal reaching the receiver from several pathways with varied lengths.
Multi-path delay spread is the difference between the largest path's greatest and shortest transmission latencies. Latency varies with surroundings, terrain, and clutter and does not map to cell radius."
7,"In Legacy 4G LTE networks and 5G NR till release 15, the UE typically releases the connection from the source cell before the connection is established with the target cell (Hard Handover). Due to this, UL and DL transmission is finalized at source cell before the UE starts to communicate with the target cell results an interruption of a few tens of milliseconds in the communication between the UE and the base station. This interruption is very critical for URLCC use case /application with in 5G. So 3GPP has proposed a solution to overcome this problem as part of Release 16 named as Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) where UE connection with source cell to remain active for Rx and Tx of user data, until it is able to send and receive user data in the target cell. This put a new requirement at UE  side to simultaneously receive and transmit data at both source cell and target cell for a short time period during the handover procedure. In my view, this is similar to soft handover procedure.","UE releases source cell connection before target cell connection in 4G LTE and 5G NR until release 15. Due to this, source cell finalizes UL and DL transmission before UE starts interacting with destination cell, creating a few tens of milliseconds of UE-base station halt. 5G URLCC needs this interruption. As part of Release 16, 3GPP has suggested Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS), where UE connection with source cell remains active until it can send and receive user data in the destination cell. During handover, UE must receive and transmit data at both source and target cells. The transition looks easy."
8,"To support DAHO, UE has to keep Dual Stack in Active state. One user plane protocol stack for the target cell, containing PHY (Physical), MAC (Medium Access Control) and RLC (Radio Link Control) layers, while keeping the second user plane protocol stack active for transmission and reception of user data in the source cell. UE receives user data simultaneously from both the source and target cell, the PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer is reconfigured to a common PDCP entity for the source and target user plane protocol stacks. To secure in-sequence delivery of user data, PDCP Sequence Number (SN) continuation is maintained throughout the handover procedure. For that reason, a common (for source and target) re-ordering and duplication function is provided in the single PDCP entity. Ciphering/deciphering and header compression/decompression need to be handled separately in the common PDCP entity, depending on the origin/destination of the downlink/uplink data packet.","DAHO requires UE's Dual Stack. One user plane protocol stack for the target cell, with PHY, MAC, and RLC layers, and another for source cell data transmission and reception. When UE receives user data from both the source and target cell, the PDCP layer becomes a common entity for the source and target user plane protocol stacks. PDCP Sequence Number (SN) continuation ensures in-sequence data transmission. PDCP provides source-and-destination reordering and duplicating. PDCP must handle downlink/uplink data packet ciphering/deciphering, header compression/decompression individually."
9,"Upon receiving DAPS handover command message, the UE suspends source cell SRBs, stops sending and receiving any RRC control plane signalling toward the source cell, and establishes SRBs for the target cell. The UE releases the source cell SRBs configuration upon receiving source cell release indication from the target cell after successful DAPS handover execution. When DAPS handover to the target cell fails and if the source cell link is available, then the UE reverts back to the source cell configuration and activate source cell SRBs for control plane signalling.","UE suspends source cell SRBs, stops sending and receiving RRC control plane signaling, and creates target cell SRBs upon receiving DAPS handover command message. The UE releases source cell SRBs configuration after a successful DAPS handover. When DAPS handover fails, the UE reverts to the source cell configuration and activates source cell SRBs."
10,"Where GUAMI identifies one or more AMF(s). When the GUAMI identifies only one AMF, the 5G-TMSI identifies the UE uniquely within the AMF. However, when AMF assigns a 5G-GUTI to the UE with a GUAMI value used by more than one AMF, the AMF shall ensure that the 5G-TMSI value used within the assigned 5G-GUTI is not already in use by the other AMF(s) sharing that GUAMI value.  Where AMF Region ID identifies the region, AMF Set ID uniquely identifies the AMF Set within the AMF Region and AMF Pointer identifies one or more AMFs within the AMF Set.","GUAMI detects AMF (s). When GUAMI finds only one AMF, 5G-TMSI identifies the UE within it. When an AMF assigns a 5G-GUTI to a UE with a GUAMI value shared by more than one AMF, it must guarantee that the 5G-TMSI value is not already in use by the other AMF(s). AMF Region ID identifies the region, AMF Set ID identifies the AMF Set within the region, and AMF Pointer indicates one or more AMFs inside the set."
11,"As indicated, 5G NR Meas Gap Length is not fixed and 3GPP specifications made it configurable. By having a fixed Meas Gap could cause unnecessarily degradation of throughput in the serving cell. The SMTC window and window duration can be set to match SSB transmissions and accordingly the MGL . For example, if we consider SMTC window duration as 2 ms and the Meas Gap Length as 6 ms, here 4 ms segment would  not  be  available for transmission and reception of data in the serving cell will result in low DL/UL throughput.","5G NR Meas Gap Length is adjustable per 3GPP specs. A fixed Meas Gap can degrade serving cell throughput. The SMTC window and duration can match SSB transmissions and the MGL. If SMTC window duration is 2 ms and Meas Gap Length is 6 ms, a 4 ms segment is not accessible for transmission, resulting in limited DL/UL throughput."
12,"The SSB periodicity can be configured for each cell in the range of 5,10,20,40,80 or 160 ms. However, mobile device do not need to measure cell signal with periodicity as the SSB and the appropriate measurement periodicity can be configured according to the channel condition. This is desirable and can help to avoid unnecessary measurements and reduce the power consumption on Mobile Device (UE). 3GPP specifications has introduced SSB-based RRM Measurement Timing Configuration window (called SMTC window) shall be notify to Device (UE) regarding the measurement periodicity and timings of SSBs that Device (UE) can use for measurements.","SSB periodicity is 5,10,20,40,80 or 160 ms per cell. Mobile devices can set SSB and measurement periodicity dependent on channel status. This reduces unnecessary measurements and battery use (UE). 3GPP specifications have introduced an SSB-based RRM Measurement Timing Configuration window (SMTC window) to alert Device (UE) of measurement periodicity and SSB timings."
13,"SS-RSRP stands for Synchronization Signal reference signal received power. It is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in Watt) of the resource elements that carry SSS. The measurement time resource(s) for SS-RSRP are confined within SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time Configuration (SMTC) window duration. For SS-RSRP determination, demodulation reference signals for PBCH and, if indicated by higher layers, CSI RS in addition to SSS may be used.. SS-RSRP using demodulation reference signal for PBCH or CSI reference signal shall be measured by linear averaging over the power contributions of the resource elements that carry corresponding reference signals taking into account power scaling for the reference signals.","Synchronization Signal strength (SS-RSRP) is the linear average of resource parts' power contributions (in Watt). SMTC limits SS-RSRP measuring time. SS-RSRP can be determined using PBCH demodulation reference signals and, if higher layers indicate, CSI RS.

14,"CSI-RSRP stands for CSI reference signal received power. It is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in watt) of the resource elements that carry CSI-RS configured for RSRP measurements within the considered measurement frequency bandwidth in the configured CSI-RS occasions. For CSI-RSRP determination CSI reference signals transmitted on antenna port 3000 shall be used, if CSI_RSRP is used for L1-RSRP, CSI reference signals transmitted on antenna ports 3000, 3001 can be used. For intra-frequency CSI-RSRP measurements, if the measurement gap is not configured, UE is not expected to measure the CSI-RS resource(s) outside of the active downlink bandwidth part.","CSI-RSRP is received signal power. It's the linear average of the power contributions (in watt) of resource elements that carry CSI-RS for RSRP measurements in configured CSI-RS instances. If L1-RSRP uses CSI RSRP, antenna ports 3000, 3001 can be used. If the measurement gap isn't given, UE shouldn't measure intra-frequency CSI-RSRP resources outside the active downlink bandwidth."
15,"Handover, or handoff in 5G NR or 4G LTE happens when a Data/Voice call is transferred from one cell to the an adjacent cell as the Mobile user moves through the network coverage area. Before any base station software is released for field, it goes through multiple level of testing’s (regression, load etc.) in Vendor’s and Customer’s Lab. This kind of testing in Lab is mostly done in cabled environment to avoid interference for self and to other cells. The objective of handover cabled setup is to simulate the field over the air scenario mean during handover signal from serving cell worsen and neighbors cell signal becomes better. Considering this in cabled setup, we need to mix the signal from two cells and control the signal path from both cell in a such way that one cell signal reduce and other cell signal increase and vice versa.","When a mobile user goes through a 5G NR or 4G LTE network service region, a Data/Voice call is transferred to a nearby cell. Before base station software is given for field, it's tested in the vendor's and customer's labs (regression, load, etc.). This lab testing is frequently cabled to reduce interference. Handover cabled setup simulates over-the-air scenario where serving cell signal declines and nearby cell signal increases. In a cabled design, we must mix and regulate two cells' signal routes such one cell's signal declines and the other's increases."
16,"The verify first verification before attempting for HO test, one should try to test that Mobile should be able to attach individual cells. This can be verified setting max attenuation in cell#1 signal path (Port 1,2) mobile should attach to cell#2 and When setting max attenuation in cell#2 signal path (Port 3,4) mobile should be able to attach to cell#1. While performing handover, you have to create a sequence script where we can control the signal path from two cells. Some digital attenuator allows this to control or create handover sequencer using GUI as shown in below figure. When creating script or configuring HO sequencer we need to to be careful on the attenuation step and interval (dB/sec), if the interval is low or step is high can cause for radio link failures (RLFs).","Mobile should be able to attach individual cells before attempting HO test. This may be checked by setting max attenuation in cell#1 signal path (Port 1,2) and cell#2 signal path (Port 3,4).
During handover, develop a sequence script to regulate the signal path from two cells. Some digital attenuators allow GUI management or creation of handover sequencers. When writing a script or establishing a HO sequencer, the attenuation step and interval (dB/sec) must be carefully considered to avoid radio connection failures (RLFs)."
17,"The Inactive RNTI (I-RNTI) is applicable to the RRC Inactive State. While comparing with other RNTI, the I-RNTI is not used to scramble the CRC bits. Instead, the I-RNTI is used to address the UE within RRC signalling messages. An I-RNTI can be allocated to a UE within an RRC Release message when it is moving from RRC Connected to RRC Inactive as part of suspendConfig. The I-RNTI is used to identify both the UE and the gNB which hosts the UE context, this is required to move the UE context from one gNB to another gNB when UE is mobile while RRC Inactive. But here is a check, 3GPP specifications does not specify the number of bits which should be used to identify the gNB, and the number of bits which should be used to identify the UE within total the I-RNTI bits. The division of the total number of bits is left to the network implementation.","The RRC Inactive State uses the I-RNTI. I-RNTI doesn't scramble CRC bits like other RNTIs.

Network implementation divides bits."
18,The RRC Resume Request is transmitted during the RACH procedure as MSG3 cannot be segmented and must be transmitted using a single Transport Block. Due to this reason the message size must be kept relatively small to make sure the reliable reception when the UE is at cell edge. Using the short I-RNTI  message size becomes 48 bit which can be transmitted using a single Transport block. The RRC Resume Request 1 message which included full I-RNTI has a size of 64 bits so it requires relatively good coverage for reliable reception. full I-RNTI support could be used for in-building or small cells  deployments where the coverage conditions are mostly good.,"As MSG3 cannot be segmented, the RRC Resume Request is sent during RACH. To ensure reliable reception at the cell edge, message size must be maintained modest. Using I-low RNTI's message size, a single Transport block can transfer 48 bits.

19,"In a wireless 5G network, when a mobile device (UE) travelling across different sites, it can be either in connected mobility or Idle mode mobility. Considering the two situation’s 5G mobility scenarios i.e. in Connected Mode Mobility UE does perform handover and in Idle mode mobility UE does cell selection/reselection.","When a UE travels across diffeent sites, it can be either in connected mobility or idle mode mobility. In connected mode mobility UE performs handover and in idle mode mobility UE does cell selection."
20,"Coverage based Inter Frequency Handover make use of A2 Event. When UE reports A2 event measurement where serving cell signal goes below than the defined threshold, the gNB determines the UE is in cell edge poor radio condition and configure Event A5 and Event A1 for inter frequency measurement. When  UE reports Event A5 i.e. serving cell signal drops below to Threshold 1 and signal from neighbor cell become better than Threshold 2, the gNB generates the target cells or target frequencies as per the measurement results. Following Layer 3 parameters are important while optimization Inter Frequency Handover.","When UE reports A2 event measurement where serving cell signal goes below than the defined threshold, the gNB determines the UE is in cell edge poor radio condition and configure A5 and A1 event for inter frequency measurement."
21,"In multi band co-coverage scenario, the frequency priory-based inter frequency handover is used to allow higher frequency to carry services as much as possible to keep low frequency band less loaded  and continue coverage. It used Event A4 related to inter frequency, where neighbor cell signal becomes better than threshold. When gNB receives Event A4 measurement and reported frequency has the highest traffic priority, gNB choose the frequency as target frequency and initiate handover immediately.","In multi band co-coverage, the frequency priority-based inter frequency handover is used to allow higher frequency to carry services as much as possible to keep low frequency band less loaded and continute coverage."
22,"When we want to connect a UE to 5G network, it has to synchronize in downlink as well as in uplink. Downlink synchronization is obtained after successfully decoding SSB, In order to establish uplink synchronization and RRC connection, UE has to perform RACH random access procedure.","When UE wants to connect to 5G, it has to synchronize in downlink as well as in uplink.

Mobile can measurement the neighbor signal transmitting on the same frequency very easy while simultaneously transmitting and receiving data from the serving cell. While for measuring cell operating at different frequency (Inter frequency Neighbors) and Other RAT (LTE is other RAT for 5G NR) mobile has to suspended communication (Tx/Rx) with serving cell and needs to tune RF module to configured frequencies (configured Meas Objects) and resume connection with serving cell after some duration.

NR PDCCHs are specifically designed to transmit in a configurable control resource set (CORESET). A CORESET is analogous to the control region in LTE but is generalized in the sense that the set of RBs and the set of OFDM symbols in which it is located are configurable with the corresponding PDCCH search spaces.

27,"Frequency allocation in a CORESET configuration can be contiguous or non-contiguous. CORESET configuration in time spans 1-3 consecutive OFDM symbols. The REs in a CORESET are organized in RE groups (REGs). Each REG consists of the 12 REs of one OFDM symbol in one RB. A PDCCH is confined to one CORESET and transmitted with its own demodulation reference signal (DMRS) enabling UE-specific beamforming of the control channel. A PDCCH is carried by 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 control channel elements (CCEs) to accommodate different DCI payload size or different coding rates. Each CCE consists of 6 REGs.

28,"A REG bundle is a set of indivisible resources consisting of neighboring REGs. A REG bundle spans across all OFDM symbols for the given CORESET. Therefore, interleaved CCEto-REG mapping can enable both a time domain processing gain and frequency domain diversity. Interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping can be visualized as a process for which REG bundle indices are continuously filled in an array row-wise first and then read out column-wise. This process is often called block interleaving. By this means, adjacent CCEs for a PDCCH are broken down into scattered REG bundles in the frequency domain. On the other hand, for non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping, all CCEs for a DCI with AL L are mapped in consecutive REG bundles of the CORESET. Once the REGs corresponding to a PDCCH are determined, the modulated symbols of the PDCCH are mapped to the REs of the determined REGs in the frequency domain first and the time domain second, i.e. in increasing order of the RE index and symbol index, respectively.","REG bundles include nearby REGs.

29,"A wider Bandwidth has direct impact on the peak and user experienced data rates, however users are not always demanding high data rate.  The use of wide BW may imply higher idling power consumption both from RF and baseband signal processing perspectives. In regards to this , new concept of BWP  has been introduced for 5G-NR provides a means of operating UEs with smaller BW than the configured CBW, which makes NR an energy efficient solution despite the support of wideband operation.
Alternatively, one may consider to schedule a UE such that it only transmits or receives within a certain frequency range. Compared to this approach, the difference with BWP is that the UE is not required to transmit or receive outside of the configured frequency range of the active BWP, which attributes power saving.","In 5G BWP has been introduced of operating UEs with smaller BW than the configured CBW, which makes NR energy efficient solution despite support of wideband operation."

In the recent RAN1# discussion, various channel coding schemes were discussed and 3GPP considered convolutional codes, turbo codes, polar codes and LDPC codes for evaluation. 3GPP has adopted Polar Coding for 5G/NR Uplink/Downlink control channel for eMBB. To improve the performance of polar coding, concatenated coding and combined decoding schemes are proposed.",A powerful and flexible channel coding scheme is one of the fundamental components of the NR access technology. 3GPP has adopted Polar Coding for 5G NR uplink/downlink control channel for eMBB.
84,"Polar codes can asymptotically (for code length going to infinity) achieve the capacity of any binary input symmetric memoryless channel with encoding and decoding complexity of the order O(N log N), where N is the code length. At present they are the only class of channel codes that are provably capacity achieving with an explicit construction. A Polar code is constructed by recursively applying a linear polarization transform to the binary input symmetric and memoryless channel W, expressed as the 2-by-2 matrix. Repeated use of the transform, n = log2(N) times, results in an N-by-N matrix, denoting the n-fold Kronecker product. Polar codes leverage a phenomenon known as channel polarization. Above transform together with a successive cancellation decoder structure turns the N available channels (N channel uses) in to another set of N bit-channels, referred to as synthesised channels, such that the capacities of these bit channels tend to 0 (fully unreliable) or to 1 (fully reliable) when N goes to infinity.","Polar codes can asymptotically achieve the capacity of any binary input symmetric memoryless channel with encoding and decoding complexity of O(N logN), where N is the code length.  A polar code is constructed by recursively applying a liner polarization transform to a binary input symmetric and memoryless channel."
85,"The proportion of reliable channels, K, tends to the capacity of the original communication channel. Data is communicated by placing information bits on the K reliable channels and placing fixed bits, usually zeros, on the N-K unreliable channels. These bits on the unreliable channels are referred to as frozen bits, and the set of their positions is referred to as the frozen set F of size N-K. Frozen bits and the frozen set is known by both the encoder and the decoder. In this way, a polar code of code length N, information word length K, and code rate R=K/N is constructed.","The proposition of reliable channels, K, tends to the capacity of the original communication channel. Data is communicated by placing information bits on the K reliable channels and placing fixed bits, usually zeros, on the N-K unreliable channels."
86,"An advantage of the class of Polar Codes is that different types of decoders are possible for the same encoder. Therefore Polar codes are suitable to be used in a wide range of scenarios with diverse requirements. In contrast, other candidate schemes, such as Turbo codes, LDPC codes, and (TB)CCs cannot provide such flexibility. The power and area efficiency of Turbo decoders deteriorates very fast when increasing the block size. LDPC codes perform typically well for large blocks and high rates, however, performance is poor for rates below half.  It is noted that such code rate range can be the most common scenario in eMBB case. ",Advantage of the class of polar codes is that different types of decoders are possible for same encoder. Compared to other candidate schemes polar codes are suitable to be used in a wide range of scenarios with diverse requirements.
87,"The performance of Polar Codes keeps improving along with increasing list size of the SCL decoder. According to our simulation with list sizes up to 2048, we have not observed any performance saturation so far. In contrast, we observe that the performance of turbo codes and LDPC codes saturates with the number of decoding iterations. As a result, the operators can keep improving the system capacity with newer ASIC technology. For example, when the list size is increased from 32 to 128 (the decoding complexity increases about by a factor of four), the BLER performance will gain another 0.5 ~0.7dB for some control channels. Therefore the system capacity can simply be increased with the availability of new Polar decoding chips.","The performance of Polar Codes keeps improving with increasing list size of SCL decoder compared to other codes such as turbo codes and LDPC codes. As a result, the operators keep moving the system capacity with newer ASIC technology."
88,"The latency performance of a communication system is analyzed for both control plane and user plane. In this post lets discuss about control plane latency. The definition of control plane latency as per 3GPP TR 38.913 is “the time to move from a battery efficient state e.g. IDLE  to the start of continuous data transfer e.g. ACTIVE” . Considering agreements made during the study item phase of NR, the control plane latency can be analyzed as the transition time from an inactive state to the time to send the first uplink packet in the inactive state.","The latency performance of a communication system is analyzed for both control plane and data plane.

93,5G networks are expected to support applications demanding ultra-reliable and low latency communication services (URLLC). To support these kind of applications 5G-NR introduced grant free uplink transmission feature a.k.a. Transmission without grant (TWG). i.e. data transmission without resource request.

94,"TWG Type 1 is very much similar to LTE semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) where UL data transmission is based on RRC reconfiguration without any L1 signaling. RRC provides the grant configuration to UE through higher layer parameter named as ConfiguredGrantConfig including the parameter rrc- ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of any UL grant in a DCI. Potentially SPS scheduling can provide the suitability for deterministic URLLC traffic pattern, because the traffic properties can be well matched by appropriate resource configuration. In type 2 an additional L1 signaling (Downlink Control Indication) is introduced, where uplink is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI. The Grant is activated and deactivated through DCI scrambled with CS-RNTI. RRC only provides the higher layer parameter ConfiguredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. The DCI signaling can enable fast modification of semi-persistently allocated resources.

The UE MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Since multiple UEs may send a Preamble in the same RACH opportunity, they will all be addressed by the same RA-RNTI. Thus, multiple Random Access Responses (RAR) may be carried in a single MAC PDU (They correspond to different UEs that initiated the random access procedure in the same RACH opportunity).","After Msg1 RACH preamble, UE sends Msg2 RAR.

Many time neighbors configuration is missed and identified while doing network drive tests. As technology evolved, 2G start having 3G nodes as neighbors and 4G use to have 3G/2G for Inter rate Mobility management.

120,"As a first level , the NBRs relation can be generated manually or RF planning tool. A general guideline, while defining the neighbor relations, the planning engineer should perform a check of Physical cell IDs for adjacent neighbor to avoid PCI collision and PCI confusion situations, these can impact the Handover and Throughput KPIs of network. The first level of NBRs relation can be provisioned in the initial configuration of system. Some system support sniffing of surrounding network (specifically small cells), where it can scan and get the NBRs information of already on-air cells by decoding broadcast information.

130,"5G NR uses several reference signals (RSs) which act as pilots. NR use DM-RS which are separated by physical channel, because 5G NR does not include cell specific reference signals. There is a separate DM-RS for the PDSCH, PUSCH, PDCCH, PUCCH, and PBCH. In addition, there is the Phase-tracking RS (PT-RS) for the PDSCH and PUSCH, Channel state information RS (CSI-RS) for the downlink, and Sounding RS (SRS) for the uplink.","RSs pilot 5G NR. DM-RS replaces cell-specific reference signals in 5G NR. Different DM-RSs exist for PDSCH, PUSCH, PDCCH, PUCCH, and PBCH. CSI-RS for downlink, PT-RS for PDSCH and PUSCH, and SRS for uplink."
131,"From jammer perspective, the best RS to jam would be the one that requires the least amount of energy to jam (i.e. least number of REs per frame), but also be essential to the operation of the link. The DM-RS for the PBCH fits the bill, because it is in the same spot every frame and only requires knowledge of the cell ID and where the PBCH is located, which can easily be known if the jammer is already able to time-synchronize to the frame. The DM-RS for the PBCH occupies one fourth of the REs assigned to the PBCH. It is also possible to jam the DM-RS for the PBCH without needing to synchronize to the cell, by jamming the correct 60 sub-carriers. Phase-tracking RS for the PDSCH are only used when the higher layer parameter Downlink-PTRS-Config is set to ON, and even then the mapping is a function of parameters timeDensity and frequencyDensity. The effectiveness of a downlink PT-RS jamming attack is not clear using the information currently available, because it needs to know how often PT-RS are enabled in practice, and what density the gNB vendors decide to use as a default.","The best RS to jam would need the least energy (i.e. the fewest REs per frame) but be critical to the link's functionality. The PBCH DM-RS fits the definition because it's in the same place every frame and only requires cell ID and PBCH position, which a time-synchronized jammer knows. 25% of PBCH's REs work for DM-RS. PBCH DM-RS can be jammed without cell synchronization by jamming 60 sub-carriers. When Downlink-PTRS-Config is ON, phase-tracking RS for PDSCH are used, and the mapping relies on timeDensity and frequencyDensity. Downlink PT-RS jamming efficacy depends on how often it's used and what density gNB providers employ by default."
132,"5G NR contains PSS and SSS which together are used for frame/slot/symbol timing as well as conveying the Physical Cell ID. There are 1008 unique Physical Cell IDs in 5G NR, the PSS has 3 possible combinations and the SSS has 336 combinations. The PSS is an m-sequence of length 127, mapped to a contiguous set of 127 sub-carriers within the same OFDM symbol. The SSS is also a sequence of length 127, mapped to the same sub-carriers as the PSS but a different OFDM symbol. The SSS uses a Gold sequence, which is formed by combining two m-sequences. Gold sequences within the same set have low cross-correlation, allowing a UE to distinguish between several nearby base stations on the same carrier at low SINR making them resilient to jamming.","5G NR uses PSS and SSS for frame/slot/symbol timing and Physical Cell ID. 5G NR has 1008 Physical Cell IDs, 3 for PSS and 336 for SSS.

SSS employs a Gold sequence made from two m-sequences. Low cross-correlation gold sequences allow UEs to distinguish between close base stations on the same carrier at low SINR, making them jamming-resistant."
133,"In 5G NR, PSS and SSS are not always mapped to the downlink resource grid in the same location, it depends on the cell’s sub-carrier spacing, carrier frequency, and the parameter offset-ref-low-scs-ref-PRB.

134,"A jammer designed to jam the PSS and/or SSS  has to synchronize to the cell in time, and identify the sub-carrier spacing, which might already available from publicly available band plans. This is only a little more complicated than PSS/SSS jamming in LTE. However, for a jammer it may be more effective for an adversary to transmit fake PSS/SSS signals rather than attempt to inject noise on top of the existing PSS/SSS, because it does not have to synchronize to a cell. It also uses less power because the PSS and SSS are designed to be detected at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus requiring more jammer power to successfully jam the signal.","A PSS or SSS jammer must synchronize to the cell and detect the sub-carrier spacing, which may be accessible from band planning. This is similar to LTE PSS/SSS jamming. For a jammer, it may be more effective to send bogus PSS/SSS signals than to inject noise on top of the current PSS/SSS, because it does not have to synchronize to a cell. PSS and SSS are designed to be detected at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), needing higher jammer power."
135,"Although it depends on the Mobile chipset and whether any PSS/SSS blacklisting algorithm exists, it may only be necessary to spoof the PSS. Spoofing the PSS and SSS involves the attacker transmitting several fake signal,asynchronous to the target 5G NR frame(s) i.e., not overlapping in time with the real PSS/SSS and at higher power. PSS/SSS spoofing can cause denial of service (DoS), which would likely occur during initial cell search.","Depending on the Mobile chipset and PSS/SSS blacklisting method, spoofing the PSS may be enough. Spoofing the PSS and SSS includes delivering bogus signals asynchronous to the target 5G NR frame(s) and at higher strength. PSS/SSS spoofing can cause DoS during cell search."
136,"The symbols assigned to the PBCH region are all within two or four slots of each other (depending on whether the carrier is below or above 3 GHz respectively), so a jammer selectively targeting the PBCH will appear to have a very low duty cycle, especially at the higher sub-carrier spacings where the duration of one slot is lower. By jamming the PBCH, UEs will not be able to access critical information they need to connect to a cell, thus preventing new UEs from accessing one or more cells. PBCH jamming can be performed in a time-selective manner if the jammer can synchronize to the target cell. Otherwise, the jammer could simply jam the subcarriers the PBCH is on using 100% duty cycle. This latter approach involves jamming 240 subcarriers, and to provide some perspective, a 20 MHz downlink using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing has 1272 subcarriers. Thus, it would involve jamming 19% of the downlink signal, leading to a jamming gain around 7 dB w.r.t. barrage jamming.","PBCH symbols lie within two or four slots of each other (depending on whether the carrier is below or above 3 GHz), hence a jammer targeting the PBCH will have a low duty cycle, especially at greater sub-carrier spacings when one slot is shorter. By jamming the PBCH, new UEs won't be able to reach one or more cells. PBCH jamming can be time-selective if synchronized to the target cell. The jammer might jam all PBCH subcarriers otherwise. 20-MHz downlink with 15-kHz subcarrier spacing has 1272 subcarriers. 19% of the downlink signal would be blocked, a 7 dB boost over barrage jamming."
137,"Despite the large number of changes in the PHY layer of 5G NR, most of the underlying protocols are very similar to those of LTE e.g. MIB and SIB messages maintain a similar structure and payload to LTE. MIB message contains essential PHY layer configuration necessary by the UE to establish a radio link with a cell, the SIB messages contain detailed information on the configuration of the cell and overall network. The SIB messages provide information such as the idle timer configuration of the network, unique cell identifiers, and the RB mapping of critical control channels. This information is always broadcasted in the clear without any encrypted. Considering these messages occur prior to authentication and are not protected, it is likely that some of these fields could potentially be leveraged for security exploits against the 5G NR. This could be achieved, for example, by spoofing SIB messages or impersonating a base station during the RRC handshake. The 5G NR has very similar RRC and Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol architecture as LTE where a number of pre-authentication messages implicitly trusted by both the UE and the base station. By both impersonating a UE or a base station, an adversary can leverage exploits.","Despite 5G NR's PHY layer changes, most underlying protocols are similar to LTE's. MIB and SIB messages' structures and payloads are comparable. SIB messages detail cell and network setup. MIB messages contain PHY layer configuration needed by UE to establish a radio link with a cell. SIB messages include network idle timer, cell IDs, and RB channel mapping. Always unencrypted. Since these messages aren't encrypted before authentication, they could be utilized for 5G NR security threats. SIB spoofing and RRC base station impersonation are examples. UE and base station inherently trust pre-authentication communications in 5G NR's RRC and NAS protocol architectures. Both UE and base station impersonation are possible."
138,"The PDCCH channel is used to send control information to the UEs on a per-slot basis. It is used to schedule downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, MCS of those transmissions, and HARQ information. The PDCCH can appear on any subcarrier; so the jammer must decode the parameter CORESET freq-domain. The parameter CORESET-time-duration, which can take on values 1, 2, or 3, indicates how many OFDM symbols the PDCCH occupies each slot. The PDCCH always starts in the first symbol of each slot, is QPSK modulated and uses polar coding.","PDCCH sends per-slot control information to UEs.

139,"In order to jam all possible locations the PDCCH might reside in, assuming knowledge of CORESET-freq-domain, the jammer would have to jam every sub-carrier, using a duty cycle of either 7%, 14%, or 21% depending on the value of CORESET-time-duration. This type of pulsed jamming attack can also act as a form of automatic gain control jamming.","To jam all feasible PDCCH locations, assuming knowledge of CORESET-freq-domain, the jammer must jam every sub-carrier with a duty cycle of 7%, 14%, or 21%, depending on CORESET-time-duration.

140,"The Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) are used to transmit user data from the gNB to the UE and vice versa, and represent the bulk of the frame. While surgically jamming these channels is possible, the adversary might as well jam the entire uplink or downlink signal. Thus, PDSCH and PUSCH jamming are two of the least important threats to consider.","Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) transport user data from gNB to UE and vice versa. The enemy could jam these channels surgically or the entire uplink or downlink signal. Thus, PDSCH and PUSCH jamming are minor dangers."
141,"The  PUCCH is used by UE to send gNB a variety of control information, including HARQ ACKs, SRs, and CSI. There are different PUCCH formats, and there are a variety of parameters provided by the higher layer to inform the UE about which subcarriers and symbols to transmit each PUCCH message. The PUCCH has an option for intra-slot hopping, which acts as a great defense mechanism. The PUCCH is modulated with either BPSK or QPSK and uses either repetition code, or polar code (depending on the number of bits to transmit). The uplink control information can also be carried on the PUSCH, meaning jamming just the PUCCH will not block all uplink control information. All of these factors make the PUCCH an extremely complicated physical channel to jam.","UE uses PUCCH to send gNB HARQ ACKs, SRs, and CSI. Higher-layer parameters tell the UE the subcarriers and symbols to use for each PUCCH transmission. PUCCH's intra-slot hopping is a strong defense. PUCCH uses BPSK or QPSK modulation with repetition or polar code (depending on the number of bits to transmit). Uplink control information is also carried on the PUSCH, therefore jamming it won't block all uplink control information. These qualities make PUCCH difficult to jam physically."
142,"5G NR random access procedure for regular UEs is very similar to that of LTE. When a UE wants to connect to a cell, it first receives the PSS, SSS, and PBCH. After synchronizing to the cell in time and frequency, it transmits a preamble over the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH), which takes the form of a Zadoff-Chu sequence that embeds a value used to temporarily identify the UE. The gNB broadcasts the candidate locations of the PRACH (in time and frequency) in case a UE wants to connect. The large number of possible locations, and the complexity required to decode the positions in real time, makes the PRACH an unlikely target for a jammer. On the other hand PRACH spoofing, where the UEs flood the PRACH might be feasible, but the 5G NR specifications do not specify the behavior of the gNB when encountering a large number of invalid preambles.","5G NR UE random access is similar to LTE.

UE is allowed to use measurements from the PBCH-DMRS when generating SS-RSRP results. The DMRS and SS-Signal are transmitted with equal power so results can be averaged directly. When UE is measuring SS-RSRP for Layer 1 reporting, then a UE can be configured to use CSI-RS measurements as an additional input. CSI-RS may have a different transmit power compared to the SS-Signals and PBCH DMRS. The gNB provides offset information to the UE so it can be taken into account during the measurement procedure.","UE measures SS-RSRP for cell selection, reselection, power control, mobility, and beam management.

In each direction, one or several transport channels can be processed and multiplexed together by the same coding and multiplexing units."
275,A valid combination is called a Transport Format Combination (TFC). The set of valid TFCs on a basic physical subchannel is called the Transport Format Combination Set (TFCS). The TFCS is signalled through the Calculated Transport Format Combinations (CTFC). In order to decode the received sequence the receiver needs to know the active TFC for a radio packet. This information is transmitted in the Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) field. This field is basically a layer 1 header and has the same function as the stealing bits in GSM. Each of the TFC within a TFCS are assigned a unique TFCI value and when a radio packet is received this is the first to be decoded by the receiver.,A valid combination is called a Transport Format Combination; set of valid TFCs on basic physical subchannel is caled the TFCS. The TFCS is signalled through the CTFC.
276,"Single-user cases have been analysed with simulations for Ping, VoIP and e mail sending and receiving. Single-user means, in this context, that there is only one mobile reserved per packet channel.
For the VoIP cases, this is applicable to both the talker and the listener. For the RTTI cases, Dual-carrier is used in the downlink, whereas Dual-timeslot is used in the uplink to achieve the 10ms TTI.
Thus a two TDMA frame interleaving scheme is applicable. The only used Ack/Nack enhancement is a shorter RRBP. Neither event based Ack/Nack nor piggy-backing of Ack/Nacks are included in the simulations.
RLC/MAC control signalling is transmitted with the same TTI as the data blocks. Since the RTT mode is ""Active RTT"", only non-distribution RLC/MAC control signalling is applicable.
End-to-end latency is typically benchmarked with a Ping traffic case. The default Ping size is 32 bytes which typically ends up with 70 bytes of RLC data: 32 bytes ICMP payload, 8 bytes ICMP header, 20 bytes IP header and 10 bytes LLC/SNDCP header.","Cases where there is only one mobile reserved per packet channel has been analyzed for Ping, VoIP and email sending and receiving.

289,"Reason for this is that when OFDM becomes clipped by the PA, the caused IBE spikes are basically impulsive noise.
 Hence the IBE of a single slot is quite noisy and vary between the slots.
 When multiple slots are measured and average value is calculated this instantaneous variation between the slots is averaged out.
 Impact of using 10 subframe test time vs one slot test time shows the histogram of in-band emission at a single RB as offset from the limit value.
 Hence, positive values indicate violation of the in-band limit.
 Without averaging, the standard deviation of the measurement result is large, and the measurement is unreliable.
 Therefore, NR Range 1 in-band emission measurement period is specified to be 10 sub-frames.

 This condition represents all multipath conditions which have a delay spread significant shorter than one bit period.
 Therefore the pure rayleigh fading statistics of bit errors is similar to those of TU and RAnpropagation conditions.
 Even for HT the energy of pathes with big delay is small compared to the energy transmitted in the first bit period.

Logical Channels used for signalling may be linked to a 1st LCG, while Logical Channels transferring Voice data could be linked to a 2nd LCG, and Logical Channels transferring web-browsing data could be linked to a 3rd LCG.  A UE can be configured with up to 8 LCG so the gNB has enough fllexibility when grouping the set of Logical Channels. A Logical Channel is linked to an LCG using the logicalChannelGroup IE within mac-LogicalChannelConfig.The remaining parameters associated with Buffer Stanis Reporting are configured using the BSR-Config.",Logical channels with similar priority are linked to the same LCG. This allows the gNB to differentiate between the volume of high prioity data and the volume of lower priority data.
710,"The combination of 5G NR technology and millimeter wave bands pioneer a new level of mobile performance with ultra-high speeds and low latencies. Momentum behind 28 GHz is growing, with the availability of commercial services, devices and  large bandwidth up to 850 MHz. The use of antenna arrays and beamforming enables the use of 28GHz band mmWave frequencies for wireless communication.",5G NR technology and milimeter wave bands pioneer a new level of mobile performance with ultra-high speeds and low latencies.
711,"From an operator’s point of view, the viability of any new technology depends on fulfilling the business case given by the business model. The business case is governed by two main factors: the required capital expenditure (CAPEX), followed by the cost to operate and maintain the network (OPEX).","The viability of any new technology depends on fulfilling the business case given by the business model and governed by two main factos: the required capital expenditure, followed by the cost to operate and maintain the network."
712,"mmWave allows beamforming that helps overcome the higher path loss, but coverage is still limited while compared to frequencies below 6 GHz, the primary spectrum being utilized by service operators. To ensure adequate coverage, a link budget analysis is essential.","mmWave allows beamforming to overcome higher path loss, but coverage is still limited.
