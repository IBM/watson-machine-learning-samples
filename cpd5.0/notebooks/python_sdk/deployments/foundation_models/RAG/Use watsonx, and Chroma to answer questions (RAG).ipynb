    "This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of Retrieval Augumented Generation in watsonx.ai. It introduces commands for data retrieval, knowledge base building & querying, and model testing.\n",

    "#### About Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a versatile pattern that can unlock a number of use cases requiring factual recall of information, such as querying a knowledge base in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index knowledge base passages (once)\n",
    "- Retrieve relevant passage(s) from knowledge base (for every user query)\n",
    "- Generate a response by feeding retrieved passage into a large language model (for every user query)\n",

'' -- Dean Winters , Although Winters previously worked with Dick Wolf on New York Undercover , he credited fellow cast member Richard Belzer with getting him the job on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . Belzer and Winters had first worked together when Winters guest starred on Homicide : Life on the Street , where Belzer was a regular . Wolf invited Belzer to join the cast of his new Law & Order spin - off after Homicide was cancelled , and Belzer told Wolf he would only join the cast if Winters was his partner on the show . Winters had a role at the same time on the HBO drama Oz and , while the SVU role was initially only supposed to last a few episodes , he was contractually obligated to Oz , and eventually departed SVU completely to focus on Oz . Winters believed that Cassidy was not unintelligent , but simply naive .

      "years before the play begins , Desirée was a young , attractive actress , whose passions were the theater and men . She lived her life dramatically , flitting from man to man . Fredrik was one of her many lovers and fell deeply in love with Desirée , but she declined to marry him . The play implies that when they parted Desirée may have been pregnant with his child . A few months before the play begins , Fredrik married a beautiful woman who at 18 years old was much younger than he . In Act One , Fredrik meets Desirée again , and is introduced to her daughter , a precocious adolescent suggestively named Fredrika . Fredrik explains to Desirée that he is now married to the young woman , whom he loves , but who is still a virgin and refuses to have sex with him . Desirée and Fredrik then make love . Act Two begins days later , and Desirée realizes that she truly loves Fredrik . She tells Fredrik that he needs to be rescued from his marriage , and she proposes to him . Fredrik explains to Desirée that he has been swept off the ground and is `` in the air '' in love with his beautiful , young wife , and apologizes for having misled her .

'' -- Dean Winters , Although Winters previously worked with Dick Wolf on New York Undercover , he credited fellow cast member Richard Belzer with getting him the job on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . Belzer and Winters had first worked together when Winters guest starred on Homicide : Life on the Street , where Belzer was a regular . Wolf invited Belzer to join the cast of his new Law & Order spin - off after Homicide was cancelled , and Belzer told Wolf he would only join the cast if Winters was his partner on the show . Winters had a role at the same time on the HBO drama Oz and , while the SVU role was initially only supposed to last a few episodes , he was contractually obligated to Oz , and eventually departed SVU completely to focus on Oz . Winters believed that Cassidy was not unintelligent , but simply naive . He voiced early on a desire to executive producer Ted Kotcheff that Cassidy not be made into the `` dumb blonde '' of the unit because:\n",
