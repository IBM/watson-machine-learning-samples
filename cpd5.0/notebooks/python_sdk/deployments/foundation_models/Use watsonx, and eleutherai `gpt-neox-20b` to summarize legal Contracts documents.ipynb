    "**Note:** The Rouge (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metric is a set of evaluation measures used in natural language processing (NLP) and specifically in text summarization and machine translation tasks. The Rouge metrics are designed to assess the quality of generated summaries or translations by comparing them to one or more reference texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Rouge is to measure the overlap between the generated summary (or translation) and the reference text(s) in terms of n-grams or longest common subsequences. By calculating recall, precision, and F1 scores based on these overlapping units, Rouge provides a quantitative assessment of the summary's content overlap with the reference(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rouge-1 focuses on individual word overlap, Rouge-2 considers pairs of consecutive words, and Rouge-L takes into account the ordering of words and phrases. These metrics provide different perspectives on the similarity between two texts and can be used to evaluate different aspects of summarization or text generation models."
